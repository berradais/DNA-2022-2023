"""
A helper function that computes the entropy of the 
discrete distribution p (stored in a 1D numpy array).
The elements of p should add up to 1.
This function ensures lim p-->0 of p log(p) = 0
which is mathematically true (you can show this with l'Hopital's rule), 
but numerically results in NaN because log(0) returns -Inf.
