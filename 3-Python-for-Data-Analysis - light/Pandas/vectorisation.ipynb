    "- Most of the application has to deal with a large number of datasets. Hence, a non-computationally-optimal function can become a huge bottleneck in your algorithm and can take result in a model that takes ages to run. To make sure that the code is computationally efficient, we will use vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization describes the absence of any explicit looping, indexing, etc., in the code: these things are taking place, of course, just “behind the scenes” in optimized, pre-compiled C code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorized code has many advantages, among which are:\n",
    "- vectorized code is more concise and easier to read\n",
    "- fewer lines of code generally means fewer bugs\n",
    "- the code more closely resembles standard mathematical notation (making it easier, typically, to correctly code mathematical constructs)\n",
    "- vectorization results in more “Pythonic” code. Without vectorization, our code would be littered with inefficient and difficult to read for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various operations are being performed over vector such as: \n",
    "- dot product of vectors which is also known as scalar product as it produces single output, \n",
    "- outer products which results in square matrix of dimension equal to length X length of the vectors, \n",
    "- element wise multiplication which products the element of same indexes and dimension of the matrix remain unchanged. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Instead of executing operations on individual array items, one at a time, your code is much more efficient if you try to stick to array operations. This is called *vectorization*. This way, you can benefit from NumPy's many optimizations."
